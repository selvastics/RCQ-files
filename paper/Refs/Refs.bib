This paper analyses the concept of resilience from a range of disciplinary perspectives and clarifies a definition in order to inform research, policy and practice. The work takes a life course approach to resilience, examining evidence derived from research across the lifespan. It incorporates the methods of systematic review, concept analysis and consultation through face-to-face meetings. The synthesis of methodological approaches enables a clear identification of the antecedents, defining attributes and consequences of resilience, validated with stakeholder partners. Through this process, resilience is defined as the process of effectively negotiating, adapting to, or managing significant sources of stress or trauma. Assets and resources within the individual, their life and environment facilitate this capacity for adaptation and ‘bouncing back’ in the face of adversity. Across the life course, the experience of resilience will vary. A large proportion of resilience research is routed within the discipline of developmental psychology, and has mainly been developed with children and adolescents. A major contribution to resilience research could be made through more multi-disciplinary studies that examine the dynamics of resilience across the lifespan, its role in healthy ageing and in managing loss, such as changes in cognitive functioning.

ABSTRACT = {The presence of missing responses in assessment settings is inevitable and may yield biased parameter estimates in psychometric modeling if ignored or handled improperly. Many methods have been proposed to handle missing responses in assessment data that are often dichotomous or polytomous. Their applications remain nominal, however, partly due to that (1) there is no sufficient support in the literature for an optimal method; (2) many practitioners and researchers are not familiar with these methods; and (3) these methods are usually not employed by psychometric software and missing responses need to be handled separately. This article introduces and reviews the commonly used missing response handling methods in psychometrics, along with the literature that examines and compares the performance of these methods. Further, the use of the TestDataImputation package in R is introduced and illustrated with an example data set and a simulation study. Corresponding R codes are provided.},

abstract = {Objectives We propose the application of a bifactor model for exploring the dimensional structure of an item response matrix, and for handling multidimensionality. Background We argue that a bifactor analysis can complement traditional dimensionality investigations by: (a) providing an evaluation of the distortion that may occur when unidimensional models are fit to multidimensional data, (b) allowing researchers to examine the utility of forming subscales, and, (c) providing an alternative to nonhierarchical multidimensional models for scaling individual differences. Method To demonstrate our arguments, we use responses (N = 1,000 Medicaid recipients) to 16 items in the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS©2.0) survey. Analyses Exploratory and confirmatory factor analytic and item response theory models (unidimensional, multidimensional, and bifactor) were estimated. Results CAHPS© items are consistent with both unidimensional and multidimensional solutions. However, the bifactor model revealed that the overwhelming majority of common variance was due to a general factor. After controlling for the general factor, subscales provided little measurement precision. Conclusion The bifactor model provides a valuable tool for exploring dimensionality related questions. In the Discussion, we describe contexts where a bifactor analysis is most productively used, and we contrast bifactor with multidimensional IRT models (MIRT). We also describe implications of bifactor models for IRT applications, and raise some limitations.},

In this work, authors generally have  emphasized model fit, and their typical conclusion is that a bifactor model  provides a superior fit relative to alternative subordinate models. Often  unexplored, however, are important statistical indices that can substantially  improve the psychometric analysis of a measure. We provide a review of the  particularly valuable statistical indices one can derive from bifactor models.  They include omega reliability coefficients, factor determinacy, construct  reliability, explained common variance, and percentage of uncontaminated  correlations. We describe how these indices can be calculated and used to inform:  (a) the quality of unit-weighted total and subscale score composites, as well as  factor score estimates, and (b) the specification and quality of a measurement  model in structural equation modeling.

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: This article describes the procedures used in the PROMIS Smoking Initiative for the development and evaluation of item banks, short forms (SFs),  and computerized adaptive tests (CATs) for the assessment of 6 constructs related  to cigarette smoking: nicotine dependence, coping expectancies, emotional and  sensory expectancies, health expectancies, psychosocial expectancies, and social  motivations for smoking. METHODS: Analyses were conducted using response data  from a large national sample of smokers. Items related to each construct were  subjected to extensive item factor analyses and evaluation of differential item  functioning (DIF). Final item banks were calibrated, and SF assessments were  developed for each construct. The performance of the SFs and the potential use of  the item banks for CAT administration were examined through simulation study.  RESULTS: Item selection based on dimensionality assessment and DIF analyses  produced item banks that were essentially unidimensional in structure and free of  bias. Simulation studies demonstrated that the constructs could be accurately  measured with a relatively small number of carefully selected items, either  through fixed SFs or CAT-based assessment. Illustrative results are presented,  and subsequent articles provide detailed discussion of each item bank in turn.  CONCLUSIONS: The development of the PROMIS smoking item banks provides  researchers with new tools for measuring smoking-related constructs. The use of  the calibrated item banks and suggested SF assessments will enhance the quality  of score estimates, thus advancing smoking research. Moreover, the methods used  in the current study, including innovative approaches to item selection and SF  construction, may have general relevance to item bank development and evaluation.},

Two samples of individuals with rheumatoid arthritis (ns = 90 and 140) provide  evidence for the reliability and validity of the BRCS. The BRCS has adequate  internal consistency and test-retest reliability. Convergent validity of the  scale is demonstrated by predictable correlations with measures of personal  coping resources (e.g., optimism, helplessness, self-efficacy), pain coping  behaviors, and psychological well-being. Resilient coping, as assessed by the  BRCS, also buffers the effects of high levels of arthritis-related and  non-arthritis-related stressors on depressive symptoms. The sensitivity of the  BRCS to changes associated with a cognitive-behavioral intervention is also  demonstrated. The BCRS may be useful for identifying individuals in need of  interventions designed to enhance resilient coping skills.},

abstract = {In this chapter, we describe the major developments in the field of resilience since its inception more than 40 years ago. The chapter is organized in four sections, the first one presenting a brief history of work on resilience. The second section is devoted to elucidating critical features of research on this construct, highlighting three sets of issues: definitions and operationalization of the two constructs at its core, protective and vulnerability factors; distinctions between the construct of resilience and related constructs, such as competence and ego resiliency; and differences between resilience research and related fields, including risk research, prevention science, and positive psychology. The third section of the chapter is focused on major findings on vulnerability and protective factors. These are discussed not only in terms of the specific factors found to modify risk within three broad categories--attributes of the family, community, and child--but also in terms of factors that exert strong effects across many risk conditions and those more idiosyncratic to specific risk contexts. The final section includes a summary of extant evidence in the field along with major considerations for future work on resilience across the life span.

ABSTRACT={<p>In a population of young adults, this study analyzes possible linear relations of resilience and positivity to coping strategies and engagement-burnout. The aim was to establish a model with linear, associative, and predictive relations, to identify needs and make proposals for therapeutic intervention in different student profiles. A population of 1,126 undergraduate students with different student profiles gave their informed, written consent, and completed validated questionnaires (CD-RISC Scale; Positivity; Coping Strategies of Stress; Engagement, and Burnout). An <italic>ex post-facto</italic> design involved bivariate association analyses, multiple regression and structural predictions. The results offered evidence of associations and predictive relationships between resilience factors, positivity, coping strategies and engagement-burnout. The factors of resilience and positivity had significant differential associations (positive and negative) with factors of coping strategies. Their negative relationship to burnout factors, and positive relation to engagement factors, is especially important. Results of structural analysis showed an acceptable model of relationships between variables. We conclude with practical implications for therapeutic intervention: (1) the proactive factors of resilience reflect a perception of self-efficacy and the ability to change adaptively; (2) the reactive factors of resilience are usually associated with withstanding experiences of change, uncertainty or trauma.</p>}}

abstract = {Discusses effortful and involuntary reactions to stress, focusing on the implications for understanding adjustment to chronic stress. The authors argue that while the concept of coping is limited to effortful responses to stress, we also must examine the complex relationships between coping and involuntary or overlearned patterns of responding to stress. Involuntary processes frequently constrain the types of coping responses that can be generated and, in turn, effortful coping responses may unintentionally initiate involuntary processes that interfere with effective coping.  The authors also distinguish between engagement (involvement with the stressor or one's mood) and disengagement (orienting away from the stressor or associated mood) responses that are both effortful and involuntary as a further step in delineating patterns of coping with chronic stress. These responses differ substantially in their efficacy in managing chronic stress. A critical distinction is also made between 2 types of effortful disengagement coping—avoidance and distraction. The former is typically associated with poor adjustment, whereas the latter most often has beneficial effects. Examples from research on psychological and physical health outcomes are discussed, with a specific focus on the association of effortful and involuntary stress responses in research on depression and cancer.

Two thousand empirical journal articles were selected from the EBSCO database. The COPE, Ways of Coping Questionnaire, Coping Strategies Questionnaire, Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations, Religious-COPE and Coping Response Inventory were frequently mentioned. In particular, the COPE (20.2\%) and Ways of Coping Questionnaire (13.6\%) were used the most frequently. In this literature reviewed, coping scales were most often used to assess coping with health issues (e.g. illness, pain and medical diagnoses) over other types of stressors, and patients were the most frequent participants. Further, alpha coefficients were estimated for the COPE subscales, and correlations between the COPE subscales and coping outcomes were calculated, including depressive symptoms, anxiety, negative affect, psychological distress, physical symptoms and well-being.

abstract = {This paper presents a critical appraisal of resilience, a construct connoting the maintenance of positive adaptation by individuals despite experiences of significant adversity. As empirical research on resilience has burgeoned in recent years, criticisms have been levied at work in this area. These critiques have generally focused on ambiguities in definitions and central terminology; heterogeneity in risks experienced and competence achieved by individuals viewed as resilient; instability of the phenomenon of resilience; and concerns regarding the usefulness of resilience as a theoretical construct. We address each identified criticism in turn, proposing solutions for those we view as legitimate and clarifying misunderstandings surrounding those we believe to be less valid. We conclude that work on resilience possesses substantial potential for augmenting the understanding of processes affecting at-risk individuals. Realization of the potential embodied by this construct, however, will remain constrained without continued scientific attention to some of the serious conceptual and methodological pitfalls that have been noted by skeptics and proponents alike.},

abstract = {Abstract Resources that protect against the development of psychiatric disturbances are reported to be a significant force behind healthy adjustment to life stresses, rather than the absence of risk factors. In this paper a new scale for measuring the presence of protective resources that promote adult resilience is validated. The preliminary version of the scale consisted of 45 items covering five dimensions: personal competence, social competence, family coherence, social support and personal structure. The Resilience Scale for Adults (RSA), the Sense of Coherence scale (SOC) and the Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL) were given to 59 patients once, and to 276 normal controls twice, separated by four months. The factor structure was replicated. The respective dimensions had Cronbach's alphas of 0.90, 0.83, 0.87, 0.83 and 0.67, and four-month test-retest correlations of 0.79, 0.84, 0.77, 0.69 and 0.74. Construct validity was supported by positive correlations with SOC and negative correlations with HSCL. The RSA differentiated between patients and healthy control subjects. Discriminant validity was indicated by differential positive correlations between RSA subscales and SOC. The RSA-scale might be used as a valid and reliable measurement in health and clinical psychology to assess the presence of protective factors important to regain and maintain mental health.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Interest in resilience has increased in recent years. The U.S. military focus is on personal health and adaptation following exposure to battle, while the civilian interest centers on adjustments subsequent to disastrous events. Coping skills are also relevant, yet the relationships between coping and resilience are unclear. OBJECTIVE: This brief review examines personal resilience and individual coping strategies, exploring definitions of each, along with their potential relationships to one another. Their potential contributions within a work setting are described. METHODS: A literature review was conducted using search terms of resilience, resiliency, personal resilience, coping and resilient coping. RESULTS: Coping refers to one’s using purposeful actions to handle life situations. Coping techniques can be functional or dysfunctional and the situations one copes with may be acute or long term, severe or minor. Resilience refers to positive and functional handling of oneself and ones’ life, referring to the ability to recover, recuperate, and regenerate following tragic events. CONCLUSIONS: While coping and resilience are related to one another, they are distinct concepts. Positive coping techniques may contribute to resilience. However, which coping techniques improve resilience, and in what circumstances, are questions for future research.},

Mastery pertains to problem-focused or assimilative coping with demands, whereas meaning refers to accommodative coping. These coping processes need not be applied exclusively, as they may occur more or less simultaneously. The focus of this chapter is on an innovative theoretical perspective that emphasizes positive coping and expands on previous approaches. The first section distinguishes between four kinds of adaptation: reactive coping, anticipatory coping, proactive coping, and preventive coping. The next section deals with situational and global approaches to the role of meaning in the coping process. Assessment approaches that try to tap innovative aspects of positive coping are (a) the mastery of future threats or challenges, as reflected by preventive or proactive coping, and (b) the search for meaning. Coping measurement is complicated by a number of conceptual issues, some of which pertain to the stability, generality, and dimensionality of coping. The Proactive Coping Scale is appended.

The purpose of this research was twofold: (a) examine the psychometric proprieties of the Brief Cope in previous studies; and (b) perform Confirmatory Factor Analyses (CFA) with second-order model and bifactor model specifications that could be used to assess the best model that represents the 14 coping strategies inherent to the instrument. In order to meet the first objective, a bibliographic review of published peer-reviewed studies between 1997 and 2021 was conducted. Results from the review identified 50 studies, of which 21 used exploratory factor analysis, 28 CFA and one study test-retest analysis. Seventeen studies used the entire correlated 14-factor structure. However, only 11 studies conducted a CFA. For the second objective, a sample of 472 working class individuals (female = 278) with a mean work experience of 19.06 years (SD = 11,92) were recruited. We tested several model specifications, convergent and discriminant validity analysis. We found the correlated 14-factor structure of the Brief COPE to have good psychometric properties. The second-order and bifactor model specifications displayed poor fit or did not converge, respectively. The measure showed good convergent and discriminant validity, and the subscales showed adequate internal consistency. We provide further validity and reliability of the correlated 14-factor structure, evidencing that this measure can assess coping mechanisms. Second-order model specifications need further testing and empirical evidence to support such hierarchical categorization. }

abstract = { The Academic Resilience Scale (ARS) was developed to measure resilience factors in educational contexts. However, there is no clarity on whether the scale could be used as a measure of unidimensional academic resilience scores or just to obtain multidimensional academic resilience factors. How a scale is scored can affect the validity of inferences based on scores obtained by using the scale in research and practice. This study uses confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and ancillary bifactor measures to examine the dimensionality of the scale. There was no sufficient support for using the scale to obtain unidimensional academic resilience score. Rather, the scale should only be considered as a measure of multiple dimensions of academic resilience factors. }

Two studies (N1 = 217; N2 = 303) assessed the psychometric characteristics of these measures in fourth- through sixth-grade children. Confirmatory factor analyses indicated that a four-factor model of dispositional coping (active, distraction, avoidant, and support seeking) provided a better fit to the data than either the problemversus emotion-focused (Lazarus \& Folkman, 1984) or passive versus active (Billings \& Moos, 1981) coping models. The four-factor model was largely invariant with respect to age and gender. Moderate to high correlations were found between the parallel subscales of the dispositional and situational measures of coping. Although the four factor structures of the dispositional and situational measures were generally similar, factor loadings and correlations between dimensions were not equivalent.},

This literature has spawned a diversity of concepts and contrasting perspectives on the determinants and effects of coping. To address this complexity, we comment on dispositional and contextual perspectives on the coping process, describe the domains of coping styles and coping skills, and review some measures of these constructs. Next, we present a conceptual framework that integrates key aspects of these constructs and use the framework to guide a selective review of the linkages between personal and social resources, coping skills, and adaptive functioning. We then consider applications of the framework to clinical practice. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Clin Psychol.},

In diesem Beitrag wird über die faktorielle und psychometrische Prüfung eines revidierten Fragebogens (SSKJ 3-8) zur Erfassung von Stressbewältigung im Kindes- und Jugendalter berichtet. Aspekte der Stressbewältigung werden mit fünf Subskalen erfasst (Suche nach sozialer Unterstützung, problemorientierte Bewältigung, vermeidende Bewältigung, konstruktiv-palliative Emotionsregulation und destruktiv-ärgerbezogene Emotionsregulation). Die Studien beruhen auf einer Gesamtstichprobe von insgesamt 1991 Kindern und Jugendlichen der Klassenstufen 3 bis 8. Die Ergebnisse zeigen gute bis befriedigende Reliabilitäten (interne Konsistenzen, Retest). Die Skalenstruktur konnte mit Hilfe von exploratorischen und konfirmatorischen Faktorenanalysen bestätigt werden. Zahlreiche Hinweise auf die Validität konnten durch Korrelationen mit Außenkriterien (Stressbewältigungs-, Persönlichkeits-, gesundheitsbezogene Lebensqualitätsvariablen) ermittelt werden. }

Believing that an event is controllable does not always lead to a reduction in stress or to a positive outcome, and believing that an event is uncontrollable does not always lead to an increase in stress or to a negative outcome. The present author shows how 2 forms of control, generalized beliefs about control and situational appraisals of control, fit into the overall model of Lazarus and colleagues. Situational appraisals of control are explored, especially as they relate to health matters. The theoretical formulation of stress and coping is drawn on to examine 3 important issues: (a) how believing one has control in a stressful transaction can heighten threat, (b) the relationship between control and coping, and (c) pathways through which control can affect the adaptational outcomes of stressful encounters.

abstract = { Zusammenfassung. Bislang war im deutschen Sprachraum kein Fragebogen vorhanden, der den multifaktoriellen Konstrukteigenschaften der Resilienz gerecht wird. Ziel der vorliegenden Untersuchung war es daher, eine deutsche Version eines multifaktoriellen, personelle, familiäre und soziale Schutzfaktoren abbildenden Selbstauskunftsfragebogens, der Resilience Scale for Adults (RSA) zu validieren. Hierzu wurde eine internetbasierte Querschnittsuntersuchung an einer nicht-klinischen Stichprobe (N = 524) durchgeführt. Ergänzend wurde explorativ eine klinische Stichprobe von Patientinnen und Patienten mit einer ersten depressiven Episode (N = 69) mit der RSA untersucht. Eine konfirmatorische Faktorenanalyse bestätigte eine akzeptable Passung des postulierten Sechs-Faktoren-Modells. Die internen Konsistenzen der Subskalen und der Gesamtskala RSA waren moderat bis hoch einzuschätzen, eine Ausnahme bildete hierbei die Subskala Strukturiertheit. Signifikant positive sowie negative Korrelationen mit Fragebögen zur wahrgenommenen Resilienz, sozialen Unterstützung und Beeinträchtigung durch Symptombelastungen belegten die Konstruktvalidität. Die Probanden der nicht-klinischen Stichprobe erreichten im Vergleich zur klinischen Stichprobe in allen RSA Subskalen sowie dem Gesamtskalenwert signifikant bessere Summenwerte. Mit der untersuchten Version der RSA steht dem deutschsprachigen Raum erstmals ein reliables und valides Instrument zur Verfügung, das auf ökonomische Weise eine multifaktorielle Erfassung des individuellen Schutzfaktorenrepertoires und damit der potentiellen psychischen Resilienz gegenüber widrigen Lebensumständen ermöglicht. }

Increasing attention is now paid to the capacity of disaster-affected communities  to 'bounce back' or to recover with little or no external assistance following a  disaster. This highlights the need for a change in the disaster risk reduction  work culture, with stronger emphasis being put on resilience rather than just  need or vulnerability. However, varied conceptualisations of resilience pose new  philosophical challenges. Yet achieving a consensus on the concept remains a test  for disaster research and scholarship. This paper reviews the concept in terms of  definitional issues, the role of vulnerability in resilience discourse and its  meaning, and the differences between vulnerability and resilience. It concludes  with some of the more immediately apparent implications of resilience thinking  for the way we view and prepare for disasters.},

METHOD: A total of  11,227 people from 30 countries across all continents participated in the study  and completed measures of psychological distress (depression, stress, and  anxiety), loneliness, well-being, and physical health, together with measures of  problem-focused and emotion-focused coping, and a measure called the  Meaning-centered Coping Scale (MCCS) that was developed in the present study.  Validation analyses of the MCCS were performed in all countries, and data were  assessed by multilevel modeling (MLM). RESULTS: The MCCS showed a robust  one-factor structure in 30 countries with good test-retest, concurrent and  divergent validity results. MLM analyses showed mixed results regarding emotion  and problem-focused coping strategies. However, the MCCS was the strongest  positive predictor of physical and mental health among all coping strategies,  independently of demographic characteristics and country-level variables.  CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that the MCCS is a valid measure to assess  meaning-centered coping. The results also call for policies promoting effective  coping to mitigate collective suffering during the pandemic.},

    abstract = { In der vorliegenden Studie wurde anhand einer Übersetzung der General Procrastination Scale (GPS; Lay, 1986) eine deutschsprachige Kurzskala zur Erfassung von allgemeiner Prokrastination entwickelt und validiert. In drei Teilstudien wurden (sprachliche) Äquivalenz, Faktorenstruktur, Reliabilität und Validität untersucht. Die GPS erwies sich als sprachlich äquivalent zum englischen Original (Vorstudie, N = 38). Die Exploration der Faktorenstruktur (Studie I, N = 1 253) lieferte jedoch keine eindeutigen Hinweise auf die Eindimensionalität der GPS. Aufgrund dessen wurde eine eindimensionale Kurzskala (GPS-K) entwickelt und in der letzten Studie (Studie II, N = 218) validiert. Die interne Konsistenz (Studie I, II) sowie die Test-Retest Reliabilität (Studie II) der Kurzskala waren zufriedenstellend. Die konvergente und diskriminante Validität konnte in Bezug auf andere Persönlichkeitsmerkmale gezeigt werden. Anhand eines Verhaltensmaßes konnten weitere Hinweise für die Konstruktvalidität gesammelt werden. Mit der deutschen Übersetzung und Entwicklung der GPS-K liegt demnach ein ökonomisches sowie reliables und valides Instrumente zur Erfassung von allgemeiner Prokrastination vor. }

abstract = {Summary This chapter highlights that resilience is a central concept for both the life span perspective on human development and for developmental psychopathology. It conveys the idea that individuals can avoid negative outcomes or decreasing trajectories of development despite the presence of significant risk factors in their environment or potentially harmful experiences during their lives. The chapter investigates the resilience in later adulthood and old age from the perspective of life span development. It presents an overview of the central assumptions and concepts of life span psychology. The chapter demonstrates that the concept of resilience can be understood as the crucial theoretical link between continuity and change. Coping in general is, today, conceived as a process by which individuals manage the challenging, threatening, or harmful demands placed upon them. The chapter emphasizes that the domain of self and personality represents only one sector of the relevant components of constellations of resilience.}

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: This article describes the procedures used in the PROMIS Smoking Initiative for the development and evaluation of item banks, short forms (SFs),  and computerized adaptive tests (CATs) for the assessment of 6 constructs related  to cigarette smoking: nicotine dependence, coping expectancies, emotional and  sensory expectancies, health expectancies, psychosocial expectancies, and social  motivations for smoking. METHODS: Analyses were conducted using response data  from a large national sample of smokers. Items related to each construct were  subjected to extensive item factor analyses and evaluation of differential item  functioning (DIF). Final item banks were calibrated, and SF assessments were  developed for each construct. The performance of the SFs and the potential use of  the item banks for CAT administration were examined through simulation study.  RESULTS: Item selection based on dimensionality assessment and DIF analyses  produced item banks that were essentially unidimensional in structure and free of  bias. Simulation studies demonstrated that the constructs could be accurately  measured with a relatively small number of carefully selected items, either  through fixed SFs or CAT-based assessment. Illustrative results are presented,  and subsequent articles provide detailed discussion of each item bank in turn.  CONCLUSIONS: The development of the PROMIS smoking item banks provides  researchers with new tools for measuring smoking-related constructs. The use of  the calibrated item banks and suggested SF assessments will enhance the quality  of score estimates, thus advancing smoking research. Moreover, the methods used  in the current study, including innovative approaches to item selection and SF  construction, may have general relevance to item bank development and evaluation.},

The dramatic proliferation of coping research has spawned healthy debate and criticism and offered insight into the question of why some individuals fare better than others do when encountering stress in their lives. We briefly review the history of contemporary coping research with adults. We discuss three primary challenges for coping researchers (measurement, nomenclature, and effectiveness), and highlight recent developments in coping theory and research that hold promise for the field, including previously unaddressed aspects of coping, new measurement approaches, and focus on positive affective outcomes.},
